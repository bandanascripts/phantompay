# Phantom Pay

Phantom Pay is an end-to-end wallet app with auth using JWTs signed and verified using RSA with option for key rotation and uses database transactions to have rollback in our hands.

## Features

- User registration & login
- JWT authentication using **RSA** key pairs
  - Private key used to sign access tokens (stored in Redis)
  - Public key used to verify tokens
- **Key rotation** support (RSA keys are swappable in Redis)
- Middleware protection for all routes
- Database **transactions with rollback** for critical flows (e.g., wallet operations)

## Tech Stack
- Golang
- MySQL
- Gin
- Redis
- JWTs
- Gorm
